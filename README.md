# RNN-Duo
This project is a Python-based tool for generating Python code using a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. It allows users to generate Python code snippets based on user input, train new models, continue training existing models, and evaluate the model's performance.
